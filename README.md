## Testing

A separate testing document has been created as [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

### Fixed Bugs

#### Date Picker Disabling Booked Dates Incorrectly
- The date picker in the booking form was not correctly disabling previously booked dates.
- To fix this, I modified the JavaScript code to parse booked_times_json correctly and used the disable option in flatpickr to prevent users from selecting already-booked dates:

```javascript
const bookedTimes = JSON.parse("{{ booked_times_json|escapejs }}");
flatpickr("#session_time", {
    enableTime: true,
    dateFormat: "Y-m-dTH:i",
    altInput: true,
    altFormat: "F j, Y h:i K",
    minDate: "today",
    disable: bookedTimes.map((date) => date)
});
```

#### JavaScript Toggle Menu Not Working on Smaller Screens
- The navigation menu toggle button (â˜°) was not functioning on mobile screens.
- To fix this I added the toggleMenu function to each relevant template (e.g., base.html and manage_bookings.html) to ensure that the toggle functionality was available across different pages:

```javascript
<script>
    function toggleMenu() {
        const menu = document.getElementById("nav-menu");
        menu.classList.toggle("active");
    }
</script>
```

## Important Note // Please Read
- The secret key has been regenerated and put in my env.py file which is hidded.
- The secret key in earlier deployment is no longer valid as it has been regenerated.
- I have regenerated the secret key twice, so the key in earlier deployement and commits is no longer in use.
- I used [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) to generate my new secret keys.
- All employee logins have been made so this cannot be done again - however I have supplied all of their login details when submitting.
